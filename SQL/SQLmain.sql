-- Some important concept
/* 
In SQL, ROW_NUMBER() is a window function that assigns a unique sequential number to each row in the result set based on the specified ordering. Here's an explanation of how it works:
ROW_NUMBER() is commonly used in conjunction with the OVER clause to define the window or group of rows over which the numbering is applied.
The OVER clause specifies the partitioning and ordering of the rows within the result set. You can define the partitioning using the PARTITION BY clause, and the ordering using the ORDER BY clause.
The ROW_NUMBER() function starts counting from 1 for the first row in the specified partition and ordering, and increments by 1 for each subsequent row.

Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of ROW_NUMBER():
SELECT ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS RowNumber, EmployeeID, Salary
FROM Employee;
